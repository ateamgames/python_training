Python Training

Random notes

1. The order of instructions matter for Python
2. You can store different types of data (such as text, numbers, boolean etc)
3. String = text (just plain text)
4. int/float = numbers / decimal numbers
5. Boolean = True/False (always capital T and F) 
6. Python understands that [] means list. A list can hold more than 1 argument 
7. You can story any type of data in a list
8. Tuples are similar with lists, however you cannot modify anything to them, they are immutable 
9. It's good practice to group your code into functions
10. Dictionaries are acting like a real dictionay. You add a value and a key pair to it (like an item and a definition)
11. Dictionaries need to have unique values, you cannot have the same value twice  
12. For Loops are useful to iterate items of a list/string/etc. It will go one by one
