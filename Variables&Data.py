#Using variables makes the programs easier to change in time
#print("There was once a man named Jerry")
#print("He was 50 years old")
#print("He really liked his name Jerry")
#print("He didn't like being 50")

#an example of how the variables are used in a program

character_name = "Jerry"   # this is a variable called character_name, it's value is Jerry (a string)
character_age = "50"         # this is a variable called character_age, it's value is also a string
print("There was once a man named " + character_name + ", ")
print("He was " + character_age + " years old")
print("He really liked his name " + character_name + ", ")
print("He didn't like being " + character_age + ", ")

#any time you want to change the name/age, you will only have to change the variable values
