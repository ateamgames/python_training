def sayhi ():
    print("Hello user")
# creates a function called sayhi. This will not do anything unless is called


print("Top")

print("Bottom")

# the flow of the top 3 commands shows that the function is called in between the print statements. This shows, how functions are called

    print("Hello " + name)

# a slightly more advance function that has a parameter called name. The function will need to input a name in order to work
