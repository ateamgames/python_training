is_male = True
is_tall = True

if is_male:
    print("You are a male")
else:
    print("you are not a male")

# Prints out that you are a male if is_male is TRUE, otherwise it will printout the else statement

if is_male or is_tall:
    print("You are a male or you are tall, or both, cant'decide")

# the OR function there is translated as "either", you can be male, tall, or both and it will printout the result
# Another useful statement is "and" where all if statements need to be True in order for it to print the result
# you can also use elif as a statement that combines else if in your code. Help to check specific logic of your program
